- Retire Uri to indicate documents in favor if iri-string based approach.
- Realized that session wasn't pulling its weight, so replace it with documents.
- Further modify xee-xpath so that we can use it fully in the test runner.
- Session is created from documents alone now.
- The load system had a crazy lifetime story. Massively simplify lifetimes.
- A lot of work to make the API cleaner.
- Isolated static context and reconstruct dynamic context each time we run.
- Improve documents API by pushing most of it down into the interpreter.
- Remove old query system. it's in xee-xpath now.

- We try to move towards a DynamicContext we can live with.
- Dynamic context owns static context now.
- Make it possible to clone a map query.
- Rework dynamic context so that it owns documents, which makes the API we want in the load functionality feasible.
- More renaming, calling the hook method "load" instead of query.
- Use xee-xpath-load from xee-testrunner.
- Move over the load from xml, file traits too.
- Use anyhow for error handling, as this is the simplest.
- Start to extract xpath load functionality from xee-xpath.
