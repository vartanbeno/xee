### Other

- Try to unwedge release-plz...
- Clippy.
- Update copyright year.
- Update all the licenses to MIT.

- Depend on specify version of chumsky to prevent weird compile errors.
- Tweak license text.

- Fix comment parsing.
- make namespaces own their strings, rather than using a lifetime which leaks through everything.
- Modify so that xee-xpath-ast uses xee-xpath-lexer
- Upgrade logos version.
- Upgrade all the dependencies. Not sure why parse error gives a different message now but it's not a priority.
- Actually use alpha6, not latest git.
- Upgrade to the a6 of chumsky so we stop relying on a git checkout.
- Convert to use Xot's OwnedName.
- Add a way to transform a pattern into another pattern replacing predicates.
- Make it so we can maintain pattern at the ast level, but in the future also on the ir level and interpreter level.
- Reorganize so that we can handle attributes better.
- Implement union and intersection rules.
- Various patterns.
- A very simple pattern registry with lookup by relative name only.
- Move some more dependencies into the workspace.
- Depend on xee-name and xee-xpath-type where possible.

- Add basic readmes for the various sub-crates.
- Factor out naming related stuff into its own module, xee-name.
- Rename old xee-xpath to xee-interpreter.
- More reworking so that compilation is separated into outer, interpretation in xee-xpath.

- Predicates in step expressions work.
- The pattern parser is getting more correct now.
- Cleanup.
- Refactor the AST and parser for patterns some more.
- Remove unneeded pattern ast stuff after refactoring.
- Kick the pattern parser into a better shape.
- More work on the pattern parser. It's still a mess though.
- More work towards a pattern parser.
- Add a pattern AST. Now to parse it.
- Nicer Variables API.
- Introduce XPathParserContext which has the parse methods.
- Work towards a cleaner API to parse and execute xpath.
- Start working on a visitor for XSLT AST. We will need to do implement expand_text, likely for renaming too.
- context-item
- Make it so that element specific namespaces are used in XSLT parser
- Infrastructure to help track namespaces during parsing.
- Actually approve snapshot.
- Parse actual XPath in value templates.
- Clippy.
- Cleaner adjust.
- Adjust error span for xpath.
- An experiment with tokens from xmlparser
- Get rid of expected found, so we can get rid of the lifetime on ParserError, which simplifies things.
- To try to integrate XPath parsing into the XSLT parser we need better error handling in XPath
- More precise errors are coming from the parser now.
- More specific errors in the xpath parser.
- Modifications so that serde is an explicit dependency.
- implement 'treat as'
- arrows for dynamic functions too.
- arrow functions for static function calls.

- Clarifying comment.
- Fix the parser: we can only have one comparison per expression, unless other binary operators.
- Make a few more casting behaviors work.

- Prepare casting to qname, though it's not working yet.
- Further progress on sequence type matching.
- Simplify element test and attribute test in AST.

- Split parser some more.
- Better organization.
- Split mega function into two, in the hopes analyzer performance goes up.
