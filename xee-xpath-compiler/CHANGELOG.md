- Tweak license text.
- Preparing licenses, attribution, etc.
- Adjust the text as we don't do execution anymore.
- We can now remove the old evaluation code in xee-xpath-compiler.
- Clean up more old cruft that isn't pulling its weight.
- Also move over arithmetic tests.
- Port the tests from the xee-xpath-compiler to the xee-xpath API.
- Non-consecutive range test.
- Check that ranges are indeed combined correctly.
- A more efficient representation of ranges.
- Fix a bug where we really need absent information in order to create the proper closure.
- Rewrite to consolidated sequence.
- Reject namespace axis as a compiler error.
- Implement parse-xml-fragment.

- Add the ability to add documents without a URI.
- Retire Uri to indicate documents in favor if iri-string based approach.

- Refactor the way collations work. This fixes 2 tests in the big test suite.
- Make things more private, and expose as methods instead.
- Clippy.
- The dynamic context builder should be built from the program.
- Let program own static context.
- make namespaces own their strings, rather than using a lifetime which leaks through everything.
- More clippy.
- Lots more clippy.
- Introduce DocumentsRef and StaticContextRef to wrap Rc away from public API.
- Isolated static context and reconstruct dynamic context each time we run.
- Add the context item to the dynamic context too.
- Use a builder everywhere for dynamic context.

- A static context builder so it's easier to create them.
- Further API cleanups.
- Improve documents API by pushing most of it down into the interpreter.
- Modify how variables are passed.
- More clippy and documentation work.
